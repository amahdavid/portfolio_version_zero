          <p>
            In this project, the user's commands were analyzed and the process was forker to run. 
            90% of the actions that the Unix terminal supports were implemented in this project.
            You launch a terminal and wait for the user to type in a command, then the command is parsed and executed.

          <h3>Collaborated on a chat program in C</h3>

          <p>
            This project involved a chat program with sign-up, log-in, channel creation, and message-sending functionality. 
            I was in charge of creating the GUI using ncurses, which included the Chat window, Login page, and Sign Up page. 
            I use pipes to transfer the user data to the client after retrieving it from the GUI, then I wait for the client to respond.

          <p>
            This project was done using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a breadboard. The project was to receive a packet using the UDP protocol between 2 Raspberry Pi's 
            Once the Raspberry Pi receives the packet, it will play a song.

          </a>
          <p>
            This project simulates a client and server communication using the TCP protocol.
            Different files can be sent by the client, and the server will receive the file and save it.
            It supports different features such as sending multiple files, sending a file with a different name, and sending a file with a different size, modify the port number
            and download path.
